ÖÖGA is currently licensed under the GPLv3 license.

We plan to replace the optimization routines that currently use GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) with non-GPL optimization functions, after
which we plan to release the future versions of OOGA under the MIT
license.

OOGA requires the following projects to compile:
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (released under 3-clause ModifiedBSD license)
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) (released under MPL-2.0 license)
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (released under the Boost software license)
- [GSL - GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for numerical optimization (released under GPLv3)
