OOGA is released under the version 3 of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) because it currently uses optimization routines from the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL). We plan to replace the GSL routines with
non-GPL optimization functions, after which the future versions of
OOGA are planned to be released under the [MIT
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

OOGA requires the following projects to compile:
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (released under [ModifiedBSD
  license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#ModifiedBSD))
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) (released under [MPL-2.0 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#MPL-2.0))
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (released under the [Boost software
  license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#boost))
- [GSL - GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for
  numerical optimization (released under [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#GNUGPL))
